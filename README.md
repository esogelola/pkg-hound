# PKG Hound

Product Hunt clone called PKG Hound, it was developed using Flask and SQLite.
This was developed for my open source python class has a final assignment.
I plan on adding more features, mainly a proper user authentication library to handle more complex things, a better database system and fully implementing a comment system.

## Getting Started

Currently the project features a CRUD implementation for the packages (products) and a very simple authentication and voting module.
You can check out my demonstration of this app here:
